            Happy Birthday!! I hope you get some time to properly celebrate - or at the very least, relax :) Here's to hoping for a lot more goodness in the year to come, time with yourself to figure things out, lots of laughter, love, and new beginnings - the best kind, of course. You're a star - even when you don't know it, and I wish sometimes I had half the no-give-up-can-do attitude you have.

           Big Mac! It's been a true pleasure getting to know you. What would I do without my favorite wine tasting partner? As Darren might say: You're a Legend Bru! I'm gonna miss you after we leave so don't be a stranger.
